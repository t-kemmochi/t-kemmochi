## Research topics

My research interest is numerical analysis for partial differential equations,
in particular, the finite element method (FEM).
I am interseted in discrete counterparts of certain properties of the original problems
and thier applications to error analysis for numerical solutions of (nonlinear) PDEs.
Moreover, I have been studying some problems on elastic curves and fluid dynamics.
The details of my research topics are listed as follows.


- Discrete maximum principle for elliptic problems for FEM
- Discrete maximal regularity (DMR) for parabolic problems for FEM
- Discrete counterpart of analytic semigroups for FEM
- Error analysis for FEM of semilinear parabolic equations via DMR
- Energy dissipative numerical schemes for gradient flows
- Numerical analysis for elastica under non-standard constraints
- Finite element method for the hydrostatoc Stokes equations
